          <p class="description">
            I am a colombian passionate Web developer who loves new challenges and innovative ideas. Programming has been one of the things that i've liked to do the most in my life since i was very young, i have always been amazed by all the creative projects that one can achieve in this field, and i think that i am here to do do something great with this, or at least that is what i found while i was doing my undergraduate in mechanical engineering.
            <br>
            Beyond my academic career, i like to do other things too, like running, dancing and traveling. Exercise is part of my life, i try to run everyday to beat my scores.
            <br>
            I consider myself an open minded person that is always looking forward for academic and personal improvment that's why my goal is to reach a balance between my academical and personal sides by not keeping locked in a routine; i can achieve that by traveling to new places and meeting new people, that helps me to be happy and keep a flexible mind to make solid relationships and think about creative ideas.
